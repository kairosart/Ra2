## Getting the certificate and key

Because this is a HTTPS server we need to use the cert and key we found earlier

1. Add certificate to Responder. You need to extract the contents of the pfx you got on [[Certificate]] to a certificate-file and a key-file.
```
openssl pkcs12 -in ~/Tryhackme/ra2/cert.pfx -out selfservice.crt.pem -clcerts -nokeys 
Enter Import Password: 
openssl pkcs12 -in ~/Tryhackme/ra2/cert.pfx -out selfservice.key.pem -nocerts -nodes 
Enter Import Password:
```

2. Edit `/etc/responder/Responder.conf`, and add the following lines at the bottom of the file.
	- SSLCert = /home/kali/Tryhackme/ra2/selfservice.crt.pem
	- SSLKey = /home/kali/Tryhackme/ra2/selfservice.key.pem
